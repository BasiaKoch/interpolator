Performances and profiling
==========================

This section reports performance benchmarks of the MLP model on synthetic
5-dimensional regression datasets of sizes 1K, 5K, and 10K samples. For each
dataset size we measure:

- Training time (seconds)
- Memory usage during training and prediction
- Accuracy metrics (MSE and R²) on validation and test sets

Summary and analysis
--------------------

- Training time scales approximately linearly with dataset size.
- Memory usage remains low (tens of MB) and does not show critical bottlenecks.
- R² scores are consistently above 0.99 on both validation and test sets, indicating
  excellent predictive performance and no noticeable overfitting.
